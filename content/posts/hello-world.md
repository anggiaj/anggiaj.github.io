How do I write hello world from time to time?

<!--more-->

Present day:
```go
fmt.Println("Hello World")
```

and yes i never write `print` only

Couple years back:
```javascript
console.log('Hello World');
```

Few years back:
```ruby
puts 'Hello World'
```

Years back:
```php
echo 'Hello World';
```
